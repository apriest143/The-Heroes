### This is the Xs and Os of how we will find our heroes.
### Each hero will be have their seasons and March Madness outings ran through this fomula
### It will begin as a simple two sided equation, 
### one being: Player Rise Score - Weighted % increases (pts/ast/reb)
###The other being: Context Score - Seed differential (normalized) Creation % during hero games 
### This will give us a simple and clean way to determine who is a hero before we get real nasty with it
